# Service Fabric Lab
## Introduction

# What is it?
Service Fabric is a platform for distributed systems.

# What problem does Service Fabric solve?

Running a distributed system (think microservices) is both fun and boring. The boring part is packaging, deploying, health monitoring, scalability, etc. Service Fabric handles these parts for you. However, if you find these parts fun, then you don't need Service Fabric :)

# How do I run Service Fabric?

TBD

You can create Service Fabric clusters in many environments. This can be in Azure or on premises, on Windows Server or on Linux.
